# .trivyignore - Vulnerability filtering for gcp-todoist-runner
#
# Alpine Linux (musl libc) has significantly fewer CVEs than Debian (glibc)
# This project uses python:3.11-alpine as base image which resolves most
# common vulnerabilities found in debian-based images.
#
# Deployment Context:
# - Platform: Google Cloud Run (stateless, ephemeral containers)
# - Base Image: python:3.11-alpine (musl libc, minimal attack surface)
# - Runtime: Python 3.11 FastAPI service
# - User: Non-root (appuser, UID 1000)
# - Network: Outbound only (Todoist API calls)
#
# Current status: 0 vulnerabilities at all severity levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
# No CVE exclusions needed with Alpine base image
#
# Alpine advantages over Debian:
# - Smaller image size (~50MB vs ~150MB)
# - Fewer packages installed by default
# - musl libc has fewer published CVEs than glibc
# - Minimal attack surface
